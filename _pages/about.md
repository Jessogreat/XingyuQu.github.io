I'm currently a second-year master's student at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), fortunately, to be supervised by Dr. [Samuel Horvath](https://sites.google.com/view/samuelhorvath). My research interests lie in understanding the science of deep learning and translating these insights into better practice. Before this. I got my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/).
